 Simulation(python script)
 ----
 In this repo, you can see two python scripts: _ardrone_rrt_, _ardrone_rrt_star_. These are simulations of this project.
 <br>
 After downloading this reposity, you can _cd_ to the directory you download, then run:
 ```
 python ardrone_rrt.py
 ```
 You can use this simulation: You can click on somewhere and a red circle will show at the place you click, which means the drone is set. Then you can click on another place. A green circle representing target will show at the place. The two black rectangles represent the obstacles in our lab. Demo is shown below:
