RRT*: Asymptotic Optimal
===
RRT* can draw the optimal path with the increase of sampling number.
<br>
<br> In the python script in this folder, you can change the iteration times by changing the value of _vertex_number_. Here, I will show the results of different times of iterations.

This one is the path drawn by 5000 iterations.

50000 iterations
<br>
<br> It is obvious that the path in 50000 iterations picture is almost optimal.
